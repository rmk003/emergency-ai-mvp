- **Point out**: Current ride information is automatically tracked
- **Highlight**: Large, accessible SOS button for panic situations
- **Explain**: Real-time status and logging system

#### Trigger Emergency
- **Click**: The red SOS button
- **Show**: Immediate visual feedback (button animation, status changes)
- **Watch**: Real-time logs showing emergency call process
- **Point out**: Call ID generation and response details

#### Explain What Happened
- **AI Generation**: Script created with incident context
- **Bland.ai Call**: AI assistant contacted emergency services
- **Data Transmission**: All relevant info (passenger, driver, vehicle, location)
- **Backup Systems**: SMS notifications and Twilio fallback

### 3. Technical Deep Dive (3 minutes)
**"Behind the scenes: Advanced AI and communication technology..."**

#### Core Technologies
- **Bland.ai Integration**: Advanced voice AI that sounds natural
- **Real-time Data**: Passenger, driver, vehicle, GPS coordinates
- **Intelligent Scripts**: Context-aware emergency communication

#### Show the Code (Optional)
```python
# Emergency script generation
def create_emergency_script(data, incident_type):
    # AI creates contextual emergency information
    # Includes all critical details for first responders
```

#### API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "call_id": "call_123456",
  "emergency_phone": "+35799000000",
  "data_used": {
    "passenger": "Maria Georgiou",
    "driver": "Andreas Constantinou",
    "location": "Ledra Street 45, Nicosia, Cyprus",
    "vehicle": "Toyota Corolla (KBA 123)"
  }
}
```
